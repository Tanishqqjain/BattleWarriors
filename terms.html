                            <p data-aos="fade-up">By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the
                                app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself,
                                and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to BattleWarriors.</p>
                            <p data-aos="fade-up">BattleWarriors is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We
                                will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
                            <p data-aos="fade-up">The BattleWarriors app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your&nbsp;responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend
                                that you do not jailbreak or root your phone,&nbsp;which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device.&nbsp;<br>It could make your phone vulnerable
                                to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could&nbsp;mean that the BattleWarriors app won’t work properly or at all.</p>

                            <p data-aos="fade-up">You should be aware that there are certain things that BattleWarriors will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or
                                provided by your mobile network provider, but BattleWarriors cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.<br></p>

                                on third parties to provide information&nbsp;to us so that we can make it available to you. BattleWarriors accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience&nbsp;as a result of relying wholly on this
                                functionality of the app.<br></p>
                                <p data-aos="fade-up">At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for system(and for any&nbsp;additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and
                                    you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. BattleWarriors does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or&nbsp;works with the Android version that
                                    you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving
                                    notice of&nbsp;termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination,&nbsp;<br>(a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end.<br>(b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed)
                                    delete it from your device.<br></p>
